0,2023_Rice_2cTYC48ZCB8.mp3," Hi everyone, my name is Serubi and I am the co-founder of Quentinx. How many of you here have tried on a virtual reality headset? Well, I am sure you all agree that there's no fun in being in a virtual world where you cannot touch or interact with virtual objects. And we are revolutionizing the way you interact with these virtual objects by building the haptic feedback gloves called extangible. Extangible means extended touch and you can touch, interact and feel virtual objects in virtual world. Three types of feedback lets you feel the recoil of a gun or even feel the texture of a ball in a virtual world. So while our focus is currently in gaming, we believe that we have the potential to transform markets like healthcare, digital education and even robotics. we are so excited to be here as well as the forefront of this emerging technology. And I will be very glad to share our vision with you all. Thank you."
1,2023_Rice_RKXMWEX2df8.mp3," Hello, take a look to the person next to you and then turn your head to the other person next to you. The sad truth is one of you three is going to have cardiovascular disease. What a downer, right? So here's the thing, you won't even know about it because most of the diagnostic tests that we have now are grossly inadequate. So think about when you go to your doctor and you get your blood drawn and you get a lip test and LDL or a total cholesterol. It turns out that one of three people is misdiagnosed either because they have a comorbidity or they are taking a medication that causes it to be inaccurate. My name is Mohammed Zayad. I am a vascular surgeon and I went to graduate school in business so I can start a company to learn how to do a better way of diagnosing cardiovascular disease. And we have developed a new blood test that's equally cost effective and more diagnostic than the current standard of care. We have a United States issued patent on this technology and we can use this in the clinic both as an outpatient, inpatient or any setting at the same exact mechanism. we are here to raise our seed round to be able to seek FDA approval without a clinical trial. Join us in revolutionizing cardiovascular diagnosis."
2,2023_Rice_KzcGA7Leq8E.mp3," Today, millions of patients suffer from a lack of effective medication. This is because the drug development process is costly and ineffective. It costs between $1 and $6 billion to take a single drug from the lab all the way through human clinical trials where they fail over 90% of the time. This is because pre-chinnacle animal models, a highly utilized step in the drug development process, consistently failed to predict clinical success. This is because these models are conducted thousands of different ways with no scientific rationale, why one set of experimental conditions are chosen over another. This is because these models would take years for scientists to manually identify the best conditions. At modern vivo, we are developing an AI-enabled software suite to help scientists automatically identify what model conditions are most associated with clinical success. And together, we can help get more effective drugs into the clinic, reduce the number of animals used in pre-chinnacle experiments, and get millions of dollars in revenue for our clients. Thank you."
3,2023_Rice_R2Ax0AucAJg.mp3," Hi, my name is Spencer and I have two secrets for you. One, crunchysy sucks and then two, the medications for crunchysy, is also suck. So what I mean is that these drugs are ineffective and expensive and if you are one of roughly one and a half million patients in US today, there is an 80% chance that you are going to have surgical intervention to resolve the inflammation in your gut as a result of crunchysy. So, imagine going to the hospital every six weeks, paying $30,000 for a name brand biological infusion only for 95% of that drug to be wasted and diluted throughout your blood stream, getting as much effective and ingredient in your toe as you are getting in the symptom act tissue in your gut. And as you list, we are creating the first bi-resorable drug delivery patch to locally deliver a drug at the symptom act site of tissue, constant training drug where it's needed most. This is an out of mind solution for patients with no drugs, sorry, with no infusions, no injections and no surgery. We have an expedient path to market and we look forward to including you in our pre-seat ground. Thank you."
4,2023_Rice_vS-zu4gdo0s.mp3," Imagine you were one of the million families in the US today whose child is at risk of developing heart failure, a lifelong condition. And when you go home, there are no methods to monitor your child's progression. So you rely on qualitative symptoms like fussiness and fatigue, which often appear too late. This results in a re-hospitalization rate of 50% in this population. My name is Carter Galki, a co-founder and CTO Mirhardt, where our device measures central Venus pressure noninvasively in the at home setting. Central Venus pressure is the main metric used for medication decisions in pediatric heart failure. This will allow for medications to be changed at home to allow these children to stay with their families. Our device is fully reimbursed through already existing pathways, which will allow families to know out of pocket costs. And we will save $14,000 per patient who use our device through the reduction in hospitalizations. Mirhardt will give these children and their families the care they deserve from the comfort of their own home. Thank you."
5,2023_Rice_410s5BmZseY.mp3," Hi, I am Gene Wei from Lupex and a Thomas driving solution provider for on-ground mining. Did you know that more than a hundred thousand on-ground miners are putting their live-ad risk due to the collision with every heavy machinery? In fact, hundreds of tragic of fatal fatalities and injuries occurred every year due to the collisions tearing thousands of families apart and costing hundreds of million dollar losses in industry. To eliminate that risk, we have collision alert by Lupex. This add-on little box was attached on a mining vehicle and it can detect the surrounding object nearby and alert drivers when they are at the near collision zone. With a price of ten thousand US dollar, it could totally eliminate improve the mining safety situation in the world via region. So let us work together and make that happen. Thank you."
6,2023_Rice_yzpUuwjBpoY.mp3," Hi everyone, I am Selan PhDC Biotechnologist and the founder of ArcBio. I came from Istanbul Turkey. The carbon dioxide level in atmosphere reached the alarming levels. This is because of the greenhouse gas emissions from the facilities. This charging capacity, wastewater from the same facilities into ocean is creating problems like misalash, ocean acidification. So, I graduated in the steel waste water and kept to carbon dioxide with microalgae to produce biofuels, bioplastics and generate carbon credits. For one acre of algae, I graduated from the potential to remove up to 2.7 tons of carbon dioxide per day. We are the proud member of the Green Town Houston and the alumnum of the mass-change early stage board in the United States and the service airlines. Our customers consist of the production facilities, municipalities, industrialists or distributual licensed oil companies, marine and aviation sectors.

7,2023_Rice_XRagKuHuvtQ.mp3," Imagine you manufacture the blades that go on wind energy turbines. Over the last two years, demand for your products have skyrocketed as demand for renewables is increased, but you've really struggled to keep up. The order books have exploded, and it's simply too costly to scale up that quickly. As you realize that you are the slowest part of this supply chain, and you are actively becoming the bottleneck in the transition to green energy, you realize you need to find a solution that allows you to do more with what you already have. Hi, we are per se as materials. And we are a group of Stanford researchers that have spent, you know, we are really passionate about this problem space, and we've spent time and lab developing a new composite material that actually solves a lot of these problems. By using substantially less time, labor, and lower cost, we are actually able to bring down the cost and composite materials to allow these companies to, you know, actually implement these solutions. But we are not just talking about wind markets. This is an application that is an aerospace automotive as well as brand new markets. we are excited about the transition to clean energy, and we are excited to create a low GHG emission composite material."
8,2023_Rice_w27p4_IHnZ4.mp3," Through 26th year, the global urban environment will double. That's equivalent to building a new New York city every single month through 26th year. But what a lot of people don't know is that for a new building, half of the environmental impact comes before you even turn on the light the first time or get the key to a new house. It's from the embodied carbon of the wall I am standing on all the desk here. Today, real estate developers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for embodied carbon analysis that's produced manually. At Parkways, we can automate that. I am Lisa Sanha and I am one of the three co-founders. Last year, we launched our first product integrating directly with 3D CAD software and we have more than 1100 architects using this to map embodied carbon. We can now use this data we have available to automate manual processes. We've just kicked off a pre-seed race of 1.2 million. We already have 200K commissed and we want to invite you to join us in decabiniting the built environment. Thank you very much. Thank you."

10,2023_Rice_vqUVxbD2NLA.mp3," I am Shia from Active Services and we are reimagining solar. Who here has seen a solar panel? they are around yay big, weigh 50 to 60 pounds, and they are in case and thick glass. Why? they are heavy and flexible, because silicon is a ceramic and it's fragile. But what if you thought about solar differently? What if you could put solar on any surface and make it active? That's what we do. Our MIT developed technology makes solar panels 120 times lighter. they are thinner than a human hair. Our B-Chead Market of Criminal Social Ware Housing only has 3% of rooftop PV today. That's $300 billion in market potential just because it can't handle the weight of solar. Our team is the one to unlock this capability. We are coming from MIT. We have industry leading advisors, we are a part of the best climate take accelerators in the program. And we have industry researchers helping us. If you can envision a future, or any surface is active, then join us."
11,2023_Rice_eM7wq-zFHbI.mp3," Good evening. This is Jack. Check out cancer after jaw. Surgeons have to remove it and replace it with a bone transplant from his leg. Today this is largely done by estimation and gut feeling. Would you want that? No. Neither would hundreds of thousands of patients who undergo cancer and accident surgeries every year. We believe they deserve precision and accuracy. I am Thomas co-founder of Inzipia from Arthur Germany. Our pattern and system for surgical planning uses our state-of-the-art AI technology. Preclinic studies have shown our solution can make surgical planning 90% faster and 50% cheaper than today's procedures. While improving patient outcomes, we are here to raise $3 million to get FDA approval and take our product into the clinics. We are Inzipia and we are shaping the future of surgical planning."
12,2023_Rice_yWUMTVJqlHw.mp3," There are over 100 million dogs who suffer from food allergies. Chicken and beef are the two most common allergens. Yet unfortunately, they are the most prevalent ingredients found in our pets food, which leads to one-third of the livestock industry being used to feed our pets, which creates a huge impact on the environment. Large pet food uses insect protein, which is hypoallergenic, sustainable, and more nutritious than chicken or beef. We have the first functional, sustainable treat on the market, and with our pet and pending hypoallergenic food, we also have the pet and pending hypoallergenic food made with insects. Sorry, lost entrance author. Pet food market is expected to double over the course of the next 10 years. Our early investors, Ushakago and tech stars are bugging out about our potential.

13,2023_Rice_iyps_vov3mw.mp3," Hi, I am Connor Crawford, CEO and co-founder of PICRA Botox. PICRA spun at a UT Austin and originally funded by Philips to see six to help with the real need they have for maintaining their product storage and refining facilities. There are 170,000 petrochemical storage tanks which use floating roots to sit atop liquid fuel. These tanks require regular safety and emissions inspections, but there are significant concerns with the current method, including safety of human crews in the financial cost of taking a tank offline. To address these problems, PICRA developed an autonomous explosion proof while climbing a robot equipped with a state of the yard sensor suite. This robot produces the same result that a human crew does but does the job faster and to a higher level of accuracy. Our business model is robots as a service, we build a customer on a recurring basis after each inspection visit to a tank site. We have two pending utility patents. We perform three demos with potential customers and we are recently contacted by Shell Game Changer about setting up a pilot study at their Deer Park refinery. we are raising a $650,000 pre-seat of which we've already closed 345,000 in large part to a national science foundation SBIR phase 1 grant. we are PICRA Botox and we are transforming inspection of energy facilities with robotics. Thank you."

17,2023_Rice_z1vrpbHQAuU.mp3," Hi, I am Angela. I am a third year medical student and in the next two years I am going to have to decide what kind of doctor I want to be for the rest of my life. There is a lot to do. There is not a lot of time to do it and there is no centralized tooling to help me make it happen. School administrators also struggle to support students through this chaos and as a result 20% of medical students don't get into residency Meaning they cannot practice medicine in the United States. So this is why we made Vivicaali a platform that consolidates the innumerable tool students are currently forced to use and Organize the student obligations all in one place. Vivicaali simplifies the most disorderly yet critical years of medical school. Students get a big picture of you while administrators get to student data insights into what they are doing so everyone gets to focus on what matters like getting into residency. We have widespread support back home at Penn and we plan on launching there this winter. We hope you'll join us for the journey. Thank you so much."

20,2023_Rice_YjrOj6NCbsE.mp3," Hi everyone, my name is Swarna and I am the founder of EnSmagable. You might notice that I am wearing glasses today, which is something I hate doing because they get smudged so frequently. That's why I am here with EnSmagable, a green permanent anti-smudge Ira Lens Coding for a lifetime of clear vision. Currently, all Ira has an olephobic or oil-fearing surface, meaning that every time you touch your lenses, the oil from your finger-singer face, clusters, causing the light to refract in a way that you cannot see through the smudge. EnSmagable's Coding allows the oil from your finger-singer face to spread, making your fingerprint invisible at all viewing angles.

22,2023_Rice_WCOb3qwBLZw.mp3," According to US Bank more than three out of four small businesses fail because they lack a well-developed marketing plan. So whose fault is this? Platforms like Google and their high advertising costs? Review sites like Yelp and their receptor practices. Or maybe just the business themselves. Or maybe it's your fault for not trying to restrain every time you see it on a billboard driving down the road. We realize that many great businesses get forgotten because there's not an effective way to market locally. Most of us want to take advantage of local promotions and deals, but the businesses struggle and getting the word to us. And that's because the best marketing doesn't come from the businesses themselves. It comes from the consumers, recommend them to their friends. But did you know that 98.5% of consumers don't leave reviews? This means that 15 people are influencing the decisions of 985. And the icing on the cake is that about a third of those reviews will be positive. Bluverse changes this by providing businesses as a space to show their local personality. We merge social media with their reviews and rewards. So now you'll have just one place and one app to interact with your favorite local businesses and save your hard earned dollars. Thank you."

We are a talent platform, specifically built for companies seeking to engage diverse early career professions. So I want you to imagine your campus recruiter who's eager about recruiting diverse talent. You currently spend your budget on career services and online's eye platforms. But the issue is 60% of students never visit career services of the 40% that do only 14% find it helpful. 75% of online resumes never make it to a recruiter. And amongst diverse candidates this disparity is higher because 6% of black professionals reported that they didn't secure an internship. 7.9% of Hispanic students have a secure to insert in comparison to 74% of white early career professionals. We built this platform to help employers connect with more high quality diverse candidates than other solutions. We do this through our hybrid recruiting model that pairs our platform with in-person engagements to deliver direct qualified candidates to companies that seek them.

So her doctor has asked her to come in every single day to get her blood drawn to have her monitor. She's a patent attorney, doesn't really have time for that, and also doesn't feel very well while she's going through all this hormone treatment. And I unfortunately know what that's like. I could have avoided two major surgeries if my biomarkers could have been monitored at home after I got hit by a car on my bike. That's why I invented the D-A-D-Ice. My name's Lund Tilley, and we have a patent pending electrochemical non-invasive sensor.

27,2023_Rice_-19FMHbcumo.mp3," All right, hello everyone. My name is Adi Metallum, a medical student at the University of Pittsburgh and co-founder of Astrobiocyntas. Traditional aneurysm diagnosis requires 5-7 people, dressed like me, and full OR tire, to conduct an invasive procedure that's not only traumatizing for the patient, but places a large hospital in on them. Now if aneurysm isn't monitored frequently enough, it can pop. Like the balloon, causing a catastrophic brain bleed. Now imagine where all of this invasive testing can be replaced by simple blood test. At Astrobiocyntas, we are developing a simple blood test that can be integrated into an existing laboratory. This blood test can be performed at the cost of 1% of the current standard of care, and it also provides a unique risk of rupture metric, which no other test on the market can provide. Seribal aneurysms have been diagnosed the same way for the past 20 years. Join me to stop the pop. Thank you."

29,2023_Rice_Sf8tmFgrFpM.mp3," Everyone, my name is Josh from GridLink and at GridLink we have built software that saves electric vehicle fleets millions of dollars per year in operational costs. In the next six or seven years the number of EVs on the road in the United States is expected to triple and many of the early adopters of EVs are large company service fleets. These large company service fleets are not used to managing EVs. All of a sudden they have to deal with variable pricing of electricity and demand charges when demand charges when they charge too many of their vehicles at one time. Our platform remotely controls and optimizes the charging schedules of an EV fleet to maximize vehicle availability and reduce charging costs by over 50%. We've been nationally recognized as a top grid-in-hand sick technology through Department of Energy, we are negotiating the terms of our first pilot program and this week we've opened our seed round. Our team is determined to help usher in the era of EVs and we'd love it if you joined us on the ride. Thank you."
30,2023_Rice_TExwcZP6Og4.mp3," Right now in the US there are 8 million infertile women which have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. And the primary reason for this is that they have ovulatory dysfunction, meaning that they don't ovulate every month, but that they ovulate irregularly. This means for these women that they go through 12 months of extreme frustration, stress, and anxiety about starting a family. And what lies ahead is IVF, which is very expensive, time consuming, painful, has low chances of success, and it's oftentimes not covered by insurance. Fortunately for these women, they can confirm they've ovulated by measuring their blood progesterone levels, with very high accuracy and specificity. And there are a lot of tests on the market right now predicting when a woman will ovulate, but very few which actually confirm it. And this is why biosensate is setting out to make the mysens a reality. It's an at home quantitative and portable blood-based progesterone sensor. If you are excited about what we are doing, come talk to us tonight at our booth. Thanks."
31,2023_Rice_bHA_LYOSJSg.mp3," I have personally faced the impact of unclean drinking water. And over the years, I have also realized that the issues not so much water scarcity, but rather clean and water availability. A much bigger issue is the helplessness that this can bring about. In the US, as an example, 77 million people consume water from sources which violate safety standards and globally, this number runs into the billions. So therefore, at the top, we are building technology like this with wood filters inside to enable access to clean drinking water as a human right. Built over a decade at Harvard and MIT, these next generation water filters can take care of the chemicals, metals, lead and so on that other filters can take care of, but they can also take care of the bacteria, viruses and protozoa that get millions of people sick in the world across the earth. At the showcase, I invite you to come have a drink with us. I believe that everybody in this world deserves the right to clean drinking water and so in closing I ask a few of this. Who's with me?"

36,2023_Rice_DcV-sMMoUiQ.mp3," To reach net zero, the United States needs between 30 to 40 times more grid-scale batteries, which require hundreds of billions of dollars of investment. Unfortunately, batteries don't make enough money to justify this investment. By co-founder and I have been at the Center of the Power Universe for the last seven years, and our first-hand experience tells us that grid-scale batteries are the new bottleneck to the Green Energy Transition. But with rising renewables in the risk of rolling blackouts greater than ever before, battery-project development is falling quickly behind. Fortunately, Tara Climbing is creating a first-vits-kind, carbon-off-set project, tied to batteries that compensation for reducing emissions on the grid, and boost revenues by as much as 20 to 30 percent. Our goal is to build the pre-minute platform for all battery services required, and we are inviting you to join us on locking a pathway to a net zero future, and a more resilient grid. Thank you."
