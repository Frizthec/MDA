00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.399
[Aneet Narendranath]: anyway. So let's get started.

104
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.269
[Aneet Narendranath]: I just thought we could meet all of us together with some

105
00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:08.299
[Aneet Narendranath]: interests in education, research, and so on.

106
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.369
[Aneet Narendranath]: and generally discuss what it is that we would like to do.

107
00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:17.990
[Aneet Narendranath]: Because the one thing we realized, at least between Radisham Jacqueline and myself

108
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.670
[Aneet Narendranath]: that we all have, you know, education, research, aspirations, and 2 heads were better than one, and 3 heads were better than 2

109
00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.610
[Aneet Narendranath]: in our case. So

110
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:42.710
[Aneet Narendranath]: the more the merrier sometimes. Yes, you know, too many cooks can sometimes spoil the bra, but you know I think we're all mature enough to understand constraints and limitations, and so on, and plan and work accordingly.

111
00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:45.049
[Aneet Narendranath]: So what I had done the

112
00:06:45.784 --> 00:06:48.525
[Aneet Narendranath]: when I planned this meeting is I shared

113
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.230
[Aneet Narendranath]: Google, Doc.

114
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.063
[Aneet Narendranath]: with everyone I can post the link in the chat if

115
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.050
[Aneet Narendranath]: having trouble accessing it.

116
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.796
[Aneet Narendranath]: I think Jacqueline and

117
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.075
[Aneet Narendranath]: Jim would probably recognize that as having some

118
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.320
[Aneet Narendranath]: team charter features. Basically.

119
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.640
[Aneet Narendranath]: it's not exactly a team charter.

120
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:28.649
[Aneet Narendranath]: but some features it does share with team charters, essentially aspirations, any measurable goals that we are working towards. Any specialization that we bring? Any miscellaneous

121
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.380
[Aneet Narendranath]: stuff.

122
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:35.370
[Aneet Narendranath]: Basically, it's it's a, it's a.

123
00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:36.020
Jim DeClerck: Really.

124
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.549
[Aneet Narendranath]: Live document to generally see if there are any mutual

125
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.549
[Aneet Narendranath]: or intersection of interests

126
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.370
[Aneet Narendranath]: which could allow for some, you know, synergistic activity publications, and so on.

127
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.895
[Aneet Narendranath]: That's what I have to say. You know that I you know. And this, like I said, is a live document. So

128
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.300
[Aneet Narendranath]: what now.

129
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:08.010
Radheshyam Tewari: Dr. Shawn, maybe driving, or, you know, stopping over some some place.

130
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:21.259
Chang Kyoung Choi: No sorry. I tried to stop the Burger King just before I stopped for lunch and attend meeting, but they have it issue. And so this guy is close, and so I'm looking for another one.

131
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.484
Chang Kyoung Choi: I just got in, Macdonald, and now, and so sorry to bother you now normal.

132
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.490
[Aneet Narendranath]: Okay.

133
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:32.280
[Aneet Narendranath]: The only Burger King I know of is in Calumet that could be wrong.

134
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.399
Chang Kyoung Choi: No, I am in market.

135
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.718
[Aneet Narendranath]: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

136
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.839
Chang Kyoung Choi: Sorry go ahead.

137
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.989
[Aneet Narendranath]: No, no, no, it's fine, it's all. It's all good. It's all good.

138
00:08:42.010 --> 00:09:02.069
[Aneet Narendranath]: Just wondering if you wanted to say something, but that's fine. Please chime in whenever you wish to. So it's a living document which we can update and so on. This is a bit of an initial condition of the situation. State of affairs, if you will. I have recorded my aspirations. Measurable goals Jacqueline, Ck. And Radisham also have.

139
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:08.309
[Aneet Narendranath]: And, Jim, you're welcome to do so whenever you get the chance, and cam as well. We've I've informed Cam of that.

140
00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:12.300
[Aneet Narendranath]: So who wants to? Yeah, sure, I understand.

141
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.680
[Aneet Narendranath]: So Dr. De clock has to reboot. He will be back soon.



207
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.430
Radheshyam Tewari: Okay. Dr. Declaunt is back. Yeah. Let's get started.

208
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.739
[Aneet Narendranath]: Let's get started. So the

209
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:34.101
[Aneet Narendranath]: we're just discussing the document that we had, especially aspirations and so on. Who wants to go first? st I don't have a structure. I'm I. I'm a little foggy right now to even discuss anything particularly

210
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.250
Radheshyam Tewari: I can go. I can go next.

211
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.250
[Aneet Narendranath]: Please, do.

212
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:48.200
Radheshyam Tewari: Okay, so anit correct me if I'm wrong the purpose of this meeting at a very high level is to develop some understanding of what we should be doing

213
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:55.982
Radheshyam Tewari: for the next year. Meaning, you know, time between now and end of August next year, 2025. Right?

214
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:09.110
Radheshyam Tewari: and and that is where that document that Anit shared comes into picture. It gives everyone general idea of the what everybody is interested in their short term aspirations long term aspirations.

215
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:29.889
Radheshyam Tewari: But by no means, though that document is you know, in some cases, for example, Jenny anit, and Dr. Choi. It may specifically talk about projects they are interested to to work on in in in the next year. But for others maybe you know, like Jacqueline and myself, the right. It is a little more generic

216
00:14:30.423 --> 00:14:33.960
Radheshyam Tewari: in terms of high level goals and aspirations. Anyhow.

217
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.529
Radheshyam Tewari: coming back to the purpose of this meeting is that I think we should just have a conversation about who wants to work on what?

218
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:50.709
Radheshyam Tewari: As long as everything is related to learning, analytics, educational research, but educational research with

219
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.759
Radheshyam Tewari: heavy emphasis on quantitative research. If I understand correctly.

220
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.020
[Aneet Narendranath]: Yeah, thank you so much. Yeah.

221
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.142
Radheshyam Tewari: Absolutely mandatory. We

222
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.440
Radheshyam Tewari: I think

223
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:08.090
Radheshyam Tewari: I don't want to say we are not interested in qualitative research, but I think quantitative research is what

224
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:13.614
Radheshyam Tewari: at least thrills me most, and I know anit is also like that.

225
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.540
Radheshyam Tewari: So

226
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:35.359
Radheshyam Tewari: if you ask me, this is a kind of a speak your mind as to what projects ideas you may be thinking about. What are one or 2 top picks as far as your thinking goes, that fits in the framework of learning, analytics, education, research, but quantitative educational research

227
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:50.030
Radheshyam Tewari: that you would like to do ideally. The way we would like to proceed is that if you put forward an idea then are you willing to lead that idea through its publication?

228
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.529
Radheshyam Tewari: Right? So if I say, I want to work on this

229
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.240
Radheshyam Tewari: ideally. You know, I should be able to lead that project.

230
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.270
Radheshyam Tewari: Manage.

231
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.989
Radheshyam Tewari: manage. I use the word, manage all the project related work

232
00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:19.279
Radheshyam Tewari: through publication, and then everyone else chimes in as and when I, you know, seek out for help or as and when it is something that someone else is better at better at than myself. So on, and so forth.

233
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:31.740
Radheshyam Tewari: all in all. If things go this way, then at the end of the year. Then we'll have multiple publications. More proofs of visibility more productivity. So on and so forth. Right?

234
00:16:32.130 --> 00:17:01.491
Radheshyam Tewari: So it's a. It's a shared leadership kind of a framework where we all bring ideas of our own and and take lead. And but of course we seek out for help, because obviously, we do not have lot of free time. We do not have any student support, and we do not certainly have enough money to buy ourselves out. So a lot of the time we do ends up spilling over the time we get as release.

235
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:08.830
Radheshyam Tewari: because, you know, this is not the only thing we do in our everyday professional lives. We have all kinds of other things. We also do.

236
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:17.880
Radheshyam Tewari: So that's where it it it that's how I make sense of what these yearly meetings are like.

237
00:17:18.362 --> 00:17:24.698
Radheshyam Tewari: And in terms of my pick I can go first.st And and just to give an example

238
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:41.518
Radheshyam Tewari: everybody is aware that we have a recently funded ev project so I would like to lead that Ev project not only in terms of you know, executing it, but also

239
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:49.443
Radheshyam Tewari: any conference papers that might come out of it between now and and next

240
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.410
Radheshyam Tewari: August

241
00:17:51.852 --> 00:18:00.939
Radheshyam Tewari: so that would be one thing. And the second thing is, I think there are some ideas Anit and I discussed when we were at the I triple Procom

242
00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:08.700
Radheshyam Tewari: related to topical topic extraction and Mdm. Analysis. Related things.

243
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:15.610
Radheshyam Tewari: So I would hold back on that until I hear if Anit is still continuing with that interest, and if so.

244
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:22.429
Radheshyam Tewari: then I would be equally trust interested to co-lead with anit on that idea.

245
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.570
Radheshyam Tewari: But my primary focus would be

246
00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:31.260
Radheshyam Tewari: to help successfully execute the yearb project.

247
00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.180
Jim DeClerck: What's the Eab Project.

248
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:41.700
Radheshyam Tewari: Okay, Anita, am I able to share screen? I can quickly share screen.

249
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.090
Jim DeClerck: Is it in the spreadsheet.

250
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.299
Radheshyam Tewari: No, it is not I I can open very quickly.

251
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.325
Radheshyam Tewari: anyhow.

252
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.264
Radheshyam Tewari: let me just quickly open it.

253
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.310
Radheshyam Tewari: has submitted.

254
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.370
Radheshyam Tewari: Yeah, be proposal here.

255
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.330
Radheshyam Tewari: Okay, so, Dr. De Clark, are you able to see the document?

256
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:13.940
Jim DeClerck: Yep.

257
00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:19.279
Radheshyam Tewari: So that's the title and mentor discourse marker model for quantitatively assessing.

258
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.970
Radheshyam Tewari: assessing, entrepreneurial mindset.

259
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:28.430
Radheshyam Tewari: And this is the project description. If you read 2, 3 lines, you will get a little bit of hang of it.

260
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.109
[Aneet Narendranath]: Just just as a note. I'm I'm no longer able to take notes on Google Docs.

261
00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:31.740
[Aneet Narendranath]: My computer started getting very, very slow for some reason, so I had to shut down my browser.

262
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.510
Jim DeClerck: Okay.

263
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.590
Radheshyam Tewari: Okay.

264
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:50.815
Radheshyam Tewari: So that was the project I was referring to when I said, I have to focus on that one because

265
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:57.100
Radheshyam Tewari: I named myself as the pi of that project, and that project is just

266
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.454
Radheshyam Tewari: taking off. And there is a lot of work to

267
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.294
Radheshyam Tewari: to be done

268
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:28.890
Radheshyam Tewari: But then, like I said, I'm interested in that. I'm interested in some ideas Nathan I were were toying with when we were at I triple Procom. And I'm more than happy to act as a as a as a helper the assistant to any other projects, ideas that each of you will be pursuing because it is our joint responsibility to support each other.

269
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.260
Radheshyam Tewari: That's it.

270
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.850
Jim DeClerck: So would would assessment

271
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.980
Jim DeClerck: type investigations fit into the

272
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.050
Jim DeClerck: quantitative

273
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.500
Jim DeClerck: requirement.

274
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.500
Radheshyam Tewari: Yeah.

275
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.069
Jim DeClerck: Learning assessment.

276
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.030
Jim DeClerck: Yeah.

277
00:21:50.030 --> 00:22:00.310
[Aneet Narendranath]: It it would. But this is looking at the general state of the art out there. Yes, it would. Depends on

278
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:13.889
[Aneet Narendranath]: where. So there are 2 pieces there, right? One of those is that it's very useful to us to as a department, to focus on something like that. The other side of the coin, if you will, is, where can this be published now?

279
00:22:15.256 --> 00:22:27.699
[Aneet Narendranath]: I, I have sensed a scale of rigor and publications at the lowest end. And please, please no one. Take this as a slide at the lowest end of rigor is asw.

280
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:44.879
[Aneet Narendranath]: and at the highest end of the rigor. Are I triple e fie, kind of conferences, or an I triple a conference generally. Now, within Aswa there are some really nice groups like education research methods which are definitely higher rigor than just general asw papers.

281
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:51.980
[Aneet Narendranath]: Now, depending on where we want the Slider to be low rigor doesn't make it a bad thing, because if you have

282
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.679
[Aneet Narendranath]: work that probably will get cited any, you know, if it's if it's good quality work.

283
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.849
[Aneet Narendranath]: the rigor essentially is the amount of

284
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:10.630
[Aneet Narendranath]: work that we would need to put in to a publication. That's how I mean that to be so in many respects I don't mind the low rigor paper, because sometimes it's low hanging fruit. Also.

285
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.540
[Aneet Narendranath]: you know. So those are all useful things. Now.

286
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.880
[Aneet Narendranath]: having framed it in that fashion

287
00:23:16.658 --> 00:23:22.760
[Aneet Narendranath]: a highly rigorous paper for an assessment thing assessment thing thing being whatever we want to do

288
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.250
[Aneet Narendranath]: would actually need a qualitative analysis that is supported with quantitative analysis.

289
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.929
[Aneet Narendranath]: Now, the qualitative analysis will have to be some sort of

290
00:23:35.618 --> 00:23:38.480
[Aneet Narendranath]: qualitative code development. You know, label development

291
00:23:39.261 --> 00:23:42.910
[Aneet Narendranath]: which can involve some manual processing

292
00:23:43.362 --> 00:24:02.380
[Aneet Narendranath]: and the quantitative side of things. You know, it could range from a whole slew of things. You know. It could be time series analysis. It could be statistical hypothesis testing it could be natural language processing. It could be large language models, and so on, so all that could vary. But if we want to focus on an assessment thing.

293
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:10.479
[Aneet Narendranath]: a high rigor paper would require a qualitative piece and a quantitative piece both. Do you have anything in mind?

294
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.250
Radheshyam Tewari: Any specific deal.

295
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.769
Jim DeClerck: Well, part of it could be. You know, things that we've been working on within

296
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.260
Jim DeClerck: within the assessment group.

297
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.575
Jim DeClerck: And

298
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:34.190
Jim DeClerck: you know, if we can. If there's something particular that's we think is unique or interesting. We could share. I I was thinking more toward

299
00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:37.160
Jim DeClerck: you know. SW, conference.

300
00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:41.860
Jim DeClerck: You know, even the Up Teaching and Learning Conference so

301
00:24:42.744 --> 00:24:46.460
Jim DeClerck: definitely low rigor, but in an audience that

302
00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:53.840
Jim DeClerck: you know, was looking for, you know, ideas to try more so than universal truth.

303
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:04.549
[Aneet Narendranath]: So. My only reservation, if you will, with the Up Teaching and Learning Conference, is that it will receive no citations in the future.

304
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:13.969
[Aneet Narendranath]: That, said one of the useful things I found with the Uptlc this year was, I could prove, a presentation that I took to a conference that could generate citations.

305
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:26.809
[Aneet Narendranath]: So there are 2 2 sides to it. You we could use it as a you know, a minimum viable product that we can proof at the up tlc, and then take to a bigger stage. So that's always a possibility. So that that approach is fine.

306
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.096
[Aneet Narendranath]: yes. Yeah, it. It depends. Yeah. I mean from personally for me, if I have the time. Yes, I would

307
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.560
[Aneet Narendranath]: be happy to contribute to something like that. So.

308
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:52.023
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Yeah, I think I'm definitely interested in the assessment piece, and then obviously, Ck, with your new title position, if you wanna call it. You know, I think that would all be a good fit, so I do think there's some value there.

309
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.347
[Aneet Narendranath]: Assessment pieces. Good.

310
00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:13.749
[Aneet Narendranath]: so just just since we are on the assessment thing, I'm I'm looking at my phone because my my computer is being slow. So assessment, right? Just just out of a hypothetical plan upcoming conferences that

311
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.790
[Aneet Narendranath]: could focus on assessment

312
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.729
[Aneet Narendranath]: which would not be in the fall semester, but in the spring semester

313
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.389
[Aneet Narendranath]: I'm sure there are some as

314
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.180
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Yum!

315
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.389
[Aneet Narendranath]: Regional conferences that occur in the spring semester.

316
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.050
Radheshyam Tewari: Yep.

317
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.620
[Aneet Narendranath]: So that's 1. The Aswa Conference itself.

318
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:39.269
[Aneet Narendranath]: Their annual conference would be roughly June or July of 2025.

319
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.050
[Aneet Narendranath]: I triple fi. Obviously, it's usually October of 2025.

320
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:55.279
[Aneet Narendranath]: So those are some things that come to mind immediately from an engineering education perspective. And if we actually have, you know, a conference paper

321
00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:02.080
[Aneet Narendranath]: targeted at one of those places. The Uptlc would be a fine place to actually prove

322
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:08.679
[Aneet Narendranath]: the slide deck and see what kind of improvement can be generated from feedback that we get there?

323
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:22.370
Radheshyam Tewari: So as a summary quickly. So far we have, you know, regardless of who has who has been the

324
00:27:22.964 --> 00:27:43.840
Radheshyam Tewari: lead, author or presenter. I think we have had visits to Uptlc. I triple E. Procom. Asw fie is coming up we are Jacqueline Anita, Dr. Sec. And I are submitting that fie conference paper, which will be in October. So

325
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:53.839
Radheshyam Tewari: by saying, summarizing you know, Dr. Dick, just for your sake. I'm bringing these names up so that you can think about those and what they

326
00:27:54.231 --> 00:28:05.179
Radheshyam Tewari: typically solicit papers on. But then you can add more, because, you know, it's it's not to suggest that only that those are the only ones we should be targeting right?

327
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.830
Radheshyam Tewari: No.

328
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:12.533
Jim DeClerck: Right? Yeah. And there's other, you know, there's other software conference. Just a note

329
00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.219
Jim DeClerck: as W in 2025 is in Montreal.

330
00:28:19.129 --> 00:28:23.609
[Aneet Narendranath]: I I definitely won't be going wherever it is, so it wouldn't matter to me.

331
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.340
Jim DeClerck: Yeah. June late June is a really sucky time to travel.

332
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.569
Jim DeClerck: Actually, I'm gonna be. I'm gonna have commitments at Los Alamos in that same timeframe

333
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.049
Jim DeClerck: for quite a while.

334
00:28:37.320 --> 00:29:01.219
Radheshyam Tewari: Actually speaking of these different venues and and our you know, fully justifiable constraints. There is another thing that we all should just keep in mind. For the greater good, if you will. Is that it's not just finding the right venue and right conference but at the end of the day, if we put in the time and effort, one of us

335
00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:29.350
Radheshyam Tewari: if not more than one of us will have to show up so that the effort doesn't go waste right? So we normally also share that burden as much as possible. It is completely fine for a particular person or 2 people to not be able to go anywhere, given their situation. But then there should be a general understanding that at the end of the day, wherever we pitch our work, it is also upon us

336
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.199
Radheshyam Tewari: to make sure. At least one of us shows up right.

337
00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:39.730
[Aneet Narendranath]: Well, yeah, I mean, all these conferences are present to publish. So we can have a paper which is great. But if you don't present. It doesn't get published.

338
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:40.740
Radheshyam Tewari: Yes, exactly.

339
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.279
[Aneet Narendranath]: We have to present. Not like. That's an option.

340
00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:44.530
Radheshyam Tewari: Exactly.

341
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:46.716
[Aneet Narendranath]: Okay.

342
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:57.480
[Aneet Narendranath]: So Radisham had a an idea. Dr. De Clarke had a a general framework that. You may want to pursue.

343
00:30:00.747 --> 00:30:13.969
[Aneet Narendranath]: again. You know, I I don't have the Google Docs open Jacqueline actually had some notes in a miscellaneous section. I think it was developing tools for assessment of reflections or something that I remember.

344
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:19.840
[Aneet Narendranath]: We have the tools. We need a qualitative coding piece actually to go with it. That's 1 something I wanted to

345
00:30:20.228 --> 00:30:29.679
[Aneet Narendranath]: actually check in with Jacqueline on. So when students develop, you know, write these reflective essays, whatever Mps or whatever else they generate these texts.

346
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.400
[Aneet Narendranath]: Thesis right?

347
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:43.114
[Aneet Narendranath]: There is a challenge there, the way they deliver the text actually mucks up the whole data pipeline and makes a lot of work. But leaving that aside completely, leaving that aside, because, considering that everything is

348
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.149
[Aneet Narendranath]: beautifully been published and usable data, let's assume that

349
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.269
[Aneet Narendranath]: The one thing we would need to do is

350
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.080
[Aneet Narendranath]: consult some

351
00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:00.929
[Aneet Narendranath]: framework that already exists. Like, you know, the critical thinking framework that we have going on.

352
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.880
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Some framework.

353
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.230
[Aneet Narendranath]: Or reflection

354
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:08.600
[Aneet Narendranath]: and extract the

355
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:15.030
[Aneet Narendranath]: dimensions from that framework very much like all those dimensions that we had in the critical thinking parallel to framework. There is

356
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.720
[Aneet Narendranath]: there? There are a couple of reflection frameworks. I can't.

357
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.239
[Aneet Narendranath]: Colb's reflection. I'll put that in the chat window just because the name came to me right now.

358
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.260
[Aneet Narendranath]: and someone somewhere, would have to sit

359
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.300
[Aneet Narendranath]: and hand code

360
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.200
[Aneet Narendranath]: all these reflective essays, either by paragraph

361
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.880
[Aneet Narendranath]: as to, if or not

362
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.490
[Aneet Narendranath]: those particular

363
00:31:44.004 --> 00:31:50.885
[Aneet Narendranath]: pieces of the framework are in there, and what the maybe there is a causality from one

364
00:31:51.948 --> 00:31:54.139
[Aneet Narendranath]: you know, label to another

365
00:31:54.180 --> 00:32:00.880
[Aneet Narendranath]: that you're probably tracking over a series of semesters or before and after some activity.

366
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.190
[Aneet Narendranath]: So that's something that needs to be developed. We have the quantitative tools to do whatever you want.

367
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.490
[Aneet Narendranath]: Almost.

368
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:19.639
[Aneet Narendranath]: We've had enough quantitative tools for that. You want to do. Meta discourse analysis. It's done. You want to apply large language models for something that's done. You want to network text network analysis that's done.

369
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.160
[Aneet Narendranath]: But we don't have a qualitative framework

370
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.769
[Aneet Narendranath]: because we need both sides of the equation.

371
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.399
[Aneet Narendranath]: We have one side, we don't have the other side

372
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:35.429
[Aneet Narendranath]: so quantitatively. We are good there qualitatively, we need to develop it. That that's time consuming.

373
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.309
[Aneet Narendranath]: Just just I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's just time consuming.

374
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.870
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Didn't know.

375
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.580
[Aneet Narendranath]: And aware of. Yeah.

376
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.355
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Yeah, definitely, a factor.

377
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.219
[Aneet Narendranath]: So Jacqueline had something.

378
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.739
[Aneet Narendranath]: that's it.

379
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.500
Chang Kyoung Choi: Sense

380
00:32:51.082 --> 00:32:54.220
Chang Kyoung Choi: fall semester I do have of all time.

381
00:32:54.610 --> 00:33:00.450
Chang Kyoung Choi: But my major contribution in this talk I you know.

382
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.839
Chang Kyoung Choi: explain. Probably major component will be spring semester. So.

383
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.019
Chang Kyoung Choi: Jacqueline, if you need to work on a discipl

384
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.419
Chang Kyoung Choi: qualitative of a framework.

385
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.540
Chang Kyoung Choi: I'll be happy to help you so.

386
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:21.430
Chang Kyoung Choi: and he said that he has. We can use his cord like that. That's a quantitative analysis. And so

387
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:28.839
Chang Kyoung Choi: I would be happy to, you know type in like a base like you, said the Manual. We have to type into that thing with a disclaimer.

388
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:37.909
Chang Kyoung Choi: I can. Yeah, I'll be happy to work with a chat clean to figure out the what frame, what we needed, and then I would be happy to type in

389
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.929
Chang Kyoung Choi: if I need a reason and use his code, yet.

390
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:51.249
[Aneet Narendranath]: No, no, that's open source code. The intent is, it should be usable by everyone, everyone being universally. The only constraint is you may have to find a student to run the code

391
00:33:52.077 --> 00:33:55.900
[Aneet Narendranath]: just because of my time. Constraints so that's the only thing

392
00:33:56.812 --> 00:34:06.369
[Aneet Narendranath]: it's open source code. Everything in there is open source. There is no reliance on any package or any software that needs to have licenses or payment, or

393
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:07.280
[Aneet Narendranath]: everything.

394
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.119
Chang Kyoung Choi: So it's in the cloud.

395
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.620
[Aneet Narendranath]: So I see.

396
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.959
Chang Kyoung Choi: Then, if you I could just show me one time how you learn. I think I may right.

397
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.869
[Aneet Narendranath]: Yeah, okay, that's that's fine. I can. I can share

398
00:34:18.468 --> 00:34:22.921
[Aneet Narendranath]: part of it is, actually, we're developing some things right now, I'll talk about that if

399
00:34:23.692 --> 00:34:28.480
[Aneet Narendranath]: if I if I can, let's see, I don't have battery. Okay? So

400
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.710
[Aneet Narendranath]: did you want to add something else, Jacqueline, to what I said.

401
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.590
[Jaclyn Johnson]: No, I don't think so.

402
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.289
[Aneet Narendranath]: And invested in.

403
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:48.900
[Jaclyn Johnson]: It was just yeah, no, my thought, and it wasn't really a well fleshed out idea, but I just thought it might be valuable to be able to do something more than having gtas. Just look at the students. Reflective essays right and.

404
00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.980
[Aneet Narendranath]: I agree, you know.

405
00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:56.229
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Some are, I mean. So the students are writing these reflective essays, and it'd be interesting to be able to like

406
00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:04.129
[Jaclyn Johnson]: group responses, or, you know, take something away versus, and I know Nancy used to do that. But she, I think, read all the essay. You know. It's something like that.

407
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.029
[Aneet Narendranath]: Language. Yeah, it has to be much faster. Really.

408
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.370
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Yeah, so and I think there's

409
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.080
[Jaclyn Johnson]: yeah. And I think I'm sure there's not useful stuff in students essays that are reflective. But I think there's also useful content that.

410
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.380
[Aneet Narendranath]: No, that's good. They're both good, you know, whether we have useful or not. Useful stuff. They're both good, actually.

411
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.255
[Aneet Narendranath]: So

412
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.670
[Jaclyn Johnson]: Yes.

413
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.333
[Aneet Narendranath]: So, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can. I can

414
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.601
[Aneet Narendranath]: touch base with everyone about the code

415
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:40.020
[Aneet Narendranath]: repository, and so on. Because right now I have a lot of python functions that are flung in different notebooks here and there. I just pull from there and there and

416
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:47.686
[Aneet Narendranath]: do things I'm trying to centralize everything right now. So one of the things I wanted to do this fall and it's coming along is

417
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:59.440
[Aneet Narendranath]: all the code that I've put together for any kind of quantitative analysis of language, specifically, is, fully python and open source. It uses packages that are open source

418
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.590
[Aneet Narendranath]: any AI large language models that it uses are open source.

419
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:09.220
[Aneet Narendranath]: So there is an organization, a a, not for profit organization called num focus

420
00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:17.989
[Aneet Narendranath]: and it, it's supported by some major industry players like, you know, NASA, Ibm Google Meta. And all these people.

421
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.979
[Aneet Narendranath]: and they

422
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:28.069
[Aneet Narendranath]: provide funds anywhere between tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for open source code development for science

423
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:38.599
[Aneet Narendranath]: So the 1st step in actually even applying for a grant such as that is to be affiliated with num focus.

424
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.490
[Aneet Narendranath]: We need to the 1st hurdle, if you will, is they need to take a look at what you're doing and say, Okay.

425
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:52.740
[Aneet Narendranath]: your kind of work is something that should be eligible for this grant. So you can be affiliated to numb focus. And at that point. It's put that in the chat window. Num, focus.

426
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.020
[Aneet Narendranath]: At that point.

427
00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.980
[Aneet Narendranath]: You can apply for grants. Otherwise you can't apply for any of their grants. You have to be affiliated to them.

428
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:10.701
[Aneet Narendranath]: So I have a an undergraduate. Well, soon to be graduate student who's written a few papers with me. And currently, we are developing

429
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.850
[Aneet Narendranath]: a

430
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:20.429
[Aneet Narendranath]: an online repository of code for basically, it starts with Meta discourse analysis. I'll see if I can

431
00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:24.379
[Aneet Narendranath]: show you what it looks like at the moment.

432
00:37:32.478 --> 00:37:44.250
[Aneet Narendranath]: But we'll develop more things into it. Centralize it all. The code that I have with network analysis and large language models, and so on. So the basic idea is that anyone anywhere should be able to

433
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.100
[Aneet Narendranath]: download this code as a package.

434
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.740
[Aneet Narendranath]: install it

435
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.090
[Aneet Narendranath]: on their

436
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.690
[Aneet Narendranath]: personal computer

437
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.560
[Aneet Narendranath]: and use it. So

438
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:08.831
[Aneet Narendranath]: it's ongoing right now, we figured out we need a code of conduct. So you know, a code of conduct a certain license for open sourcing.

439
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.799
[Aneet Narendranath]: a little information about what's going on, and

440
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.440
[Aneet Narendranath]: some code which currently resides, as

441
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:28.670
[Aneet Narendranath]: you know, Python notebooks, some initial data analysis entrepreneurial pitch analysis and so on. So it's all Python code right now. It resides as notebooks

442
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:34.800
[Aneet Narendranath]: hopefully, by the middle of August to maybe middle of September, I hope.

443
00:38:35.423 --> 00:38:39.410
[Aneet Narendranath]: We would have completed whatever we needed to do

444
00:38:40.022 --> 00:38:42.417
[Aneet Narendranath]: on this, and we'll submit it for

445
00:38:43.306 --> 00:38:47.270
[Aneet Narendranath]: affiliation consideration with num focus and see how that goes.

446
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.450
[Aneet Narendranath]: So

447
00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:58.289
[Aneet Narendranath]: around that time, I'll actually have a code base that's fully centralized for anyone to use without having to search for it here and there will all be in one place.

448
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.576
[Aneet Narendranath]: It has some major

449
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:08.199
[Aneet Narendranath]: I I constraints. One of the constraints is that there needs to be this online repository that I showed needs to have

450
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:16.640
[Aneet Narendranath]: 2 contributors code contributors which we have at the moment. The other student is Zack Tolander. So Zack and I are contributing core to that

451
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.199
[Aneet Narendranath]: and it needs to have regular

452
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.990
[Aneet Narendranath]: what is it called version control operations to show that there are at least 2 people contributing regularly.

453
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:35.380
[Aneet Narendranath]: and to show that we actually follow certain standards of version control for code. And don't just, you know, do version one version 2 and all. That's the same thing. But

454
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:43.370
[Aneet Narendranath]: with diffing, differencing files and so on. So we are doing it on a daily basis, Zack and I, very

455
00:39:44.807 --> 00:39:48.829
[Aneet Narendranath]: in a focused fashion, we write code at night and put it on there

456
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.759
[Aneet Narendranath]: not, just to show that we're doing it. But it's necessary that we have all that code in there.

457
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.189
[Aneet Narendranath]: So that's going on right now. I believe the num focus affiliation

458
00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:06.740
[Aneet Narendranath]: Deadline is sometime in October, and I hope to make that so that's 1 of the major things I'll be working on for part of the end of the summer and the beginning of the fall semester

459
00:40:08.073 --> 00:40:18.566
[Aneet Narendranath]: and that will that will play into, you know, if ck wants to use any of that python code. It'll all be available in one place, and you know, for Jacqueline to use, or whatever

460
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:24.539
[Aneet Narendranath]: part of that will also have some large language model capacity for qualitative labeling.

461
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.140
[Aneet Narendranath]: The the issue with that is that

462
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:35.560
[Aneet Narendranath]: the field hasn't yet moved to large language models for qualitative labeling. They still only believe human labels.

463
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.780
[Aneet Narendranath]: So that's the time consumption part. Whenever we have to do any qualitative work.

464
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:47.430
[Aneet Narendranath]: But at the end of this meeting. I'll share some resources with you on qualitative labeling and how to go about it. Maybe that will be helpful going forward.

465
00:40:47.710 --> 00:41:02.269
[Aneet Narendranath]: So so again, just to recap. Rajesham has an Ab. Project that he must do not much of an option there. He is also planning on an I triply procom thing for next year with Meta, discourse, analysis, and so on.

466
00:41:03.198 --> 00:41:09.200
[Aneet Narendranath]: Jim Decla mentioned something about assessment and possible venues for it for next year.

467
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.590
[Aneet Narendranath]: Jacqueline may have

468
00:41:12.122 --> 00:41:21.299
[Aneet Narendranath]: some reflective writing assessment that needs a qualitative angle that Ck. Said he'd be happy to help with as in when possible.

469
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:38.479
[Aneet Narendranath]: I have some code base that's coming together quite well, and once it's all centralized, makes it so much more easier for people to use it and actually not modify it to a point of no recovery. That's 1 of the key pieces. So that's where we are at right now

470
00:41:39.002 --> 00:41:41.260
[Aneet Narendranath]: anything else that we should touch on

471
00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:46.822
[Aneet Narendranath]: before we close was it's been oh, I don't know. When did we start? I don't remember when we started one.

472
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.190
Radheshyam Tewari: Yeah, 1, 30.

473
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.585
[Aneet Narendranath]: So, yeah, yeah.

474
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.990
Chang Kyoung Choi: Well done!

475
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.420
Radheshyam Tewari: Yeah, go ahead. That's chuck.

476
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.479
Chang Kyoung Choi: Once. Yeah.

477
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:57.419
Chang Kyoung Choi: let me finish the one thing.

478
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:10.380
Chang Kyoung Choi: Jim, I don't think you heard it, but I am going to apply the active coaching. What it means. I think I'm I will have the active coaching to individual student or group of student

479
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.129
Chang Kyoung Choi: through the my class, a thermodynamic class teaching the particularly

480
00:42:16.029 --> 00:42:20.259
Chang Kyoung Choi: teaching the engine problem solving procedure, focusing on

481
00:42:21.395 --> 00:42:31.700
Chang Kyoung Choi: critical thinking, how they actually draw the schematic and the make assumption. Basically, I tried that. So

482
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:38.999
Chang Kyoung Choi: through that I want to also assess the student the performance, and that their understanding

483
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:56.070
Chang Kyoung Choi: then that's a material would be yeah source for the hour or conference paper, or I could just journal paper, whatever that's not will be done. Anything. The end of the next spring semester. That's why there is a nothing, for my end is really focusing on so. But.

484
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.880
Jim DeClerck: The spring right.

485
00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.670
Chang Kyoung Choi: Yes, yes, so

486
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:14.129
Chang Kyoung Choi: so. But before that I want to develop the you know the how I can, how we can actually assess the student the performance. That means I need to develop the some survey question or particular. I think you know

487
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:24.739
Chang Kyoung Choi: a question or problems to check the whether they are actually improving. So those kind of things I will talk to you guys. And I need your help also.

488
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.120
Jim DeClerck: Okay, what's your weekend

489
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.490
Jim DeClerck: spot there? Because there's other sections, right?

490
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.540
Jim DeClerck: You could use them all sections.

491
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.150
Jim DeClerck: And if you have a similar instrument to those students. Then you would

492
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.369
Jim DeClerck: you could have some comparison.

493
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:54.986
Chang Kyoung Choi: Okay. But even from my class, if is, is not the mandatory to all the students, I will be just. This will be the optional to the anyone. So I will. I will have that. Think

494
00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.520
Chang Kyoung Choi: like a

495
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:02.660
Chang Kyoung Choi: any any student who who wants to, you know, volunteer, decide to take the my like a coaching.

496
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:03.530
Jim DeClerck: Okay.

497
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:12.169
Chang Kyoung Choi: I don't want to bother other section at this moment. I will just you know, file the study through the my class on it.

498
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:32.380
[Aneet Narendranath]: So I have a a quick thing for ck, and you know everyone else, for that matter, anytime we are using student artifacts. We should consider Irb, we should consider it. I'm not saying it has. It is mandatory. If you're creating a model that generalizes student behavior, student performance. Student X, we need Irb

499
00:44:32.783 --> 00:44:48.240
[Aneet Narendranath]: institutional review. But if we are looking from a Qi Qi quality, improvement or quality assurance standpoint for course quality assurance, it is very likely you do not need Irp, but it's useful to have it so on that point one of the things.

500
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:57.309
[Aneet Narendranath]: I've had some experience with the Irb process here. It has been a very long and it's it's it's very long, is the issue.

501
00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:06.439
[Aneet Narendranath]: Maybe that will change in the coming months, because the last couple of years they've had just one person working in the Irb office, and that person was outsourced somewhere in New York.

502
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:22.589
[Aneet Narendranath]: So we didn't have a Michigan tech human research protocol. And person at Michigan Tech, they're hiring someone, or they've hired someone recently. So that may change things. One of the things I had lots of conversations with that Irb person was, hey, look for every project I need to start.

503
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.210
[Aneet Narendranath]: I need to do an Irb process, and the Irb process is taking me like 3 to 6 months.

504
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.730
[Aneet Narendranath]: So is it possible to

505
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.809
[Aneet Narendranath]: get a blanket Irb, for a lot of my projects.

506
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.120
[Aneet Narendranath]: Now, that's not usually done

507
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.540
[Aneet Narendranath]: because

508
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:56.110
[Aneet Narendranath]: Irb questionnaires are very specific to a project. So you can't really do a blanket questionnaire for 4 different courses, or 4 different types of students, and so on. But they said they would be happy to investigate that if the Department wants to pursue that at a department level.

509
00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.410
[Aneet Narendranath]: so that a lot of the projects that we do can go through that particular

510
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.350
[Aneet Narendranath]: person or point of contact.

511
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:14.709
[Aneet Narendranath]: Usually that person or point of contact would need to be like Dr. Allen, associate director, or, you know, director of undergraduate studies or an associate chair.

512
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:25.260
[Aneet Narendranath]: So that's that's not a hard and fast rule, but that's what the Irb person inform me like in 2023. So this is a separate thing that

513
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:36.188
[Aneet Narendranath]: maybe we need to talk about this at a department level, or talk about this with Dr. Allen. I've tried to broach that topic a couple of times with him, but you know I was a single person trying to do some irb things.

514
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.930
Chang Kyoung Choi: I would chip in.

515
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.000
[Aneet Narendranath]: Pardon me.

516
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.759
Chang Kyoung Choi: I will tip in, though

517
00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:45.730
Chang Kyoung Choi: I will. I will say something about that to Jeff next time.

518
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.642
[Aneet Narendranath]: Okay. Because that would be very useful.

519
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:54.760
[Aneet Narendranath]: it's it's a long drawn out effort for each paper. If you need to spend 6 months and

520
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.559
[Aneet Narendranath]: tens of hours doing documentation.

521
00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.009
[Aneet Narendranath]: Just a dream.

522
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:12.479
Chang Kyoung Choi: In that sense. Anit. I think I haven't done anything for the these, I think educational purposes, but I had it handled all the biological sample that time. Also I need the Ilb. But that sense.

523
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:21.499
Chang Kyoung Choi: as long as title and the score is belong to the things of what I am doing. I just if you knew it. I didn't make the every I think

524
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.700
Chang Kyoung Choi: the single Ilb.

525
00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:33.970
[Aneet Narendranath]: So the reason was, you probably had this one major project with different components. So my irbs were different because they were all separate projects with very little link between them.

526
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.150
Chang Kyoung Choi: That means you can have a little bigger one and then cover all things.

527
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.590
[Aneet Narendranath]: The the other issue was, since all these different projects were in different courses.

528
00:47:43.330 --> 00:48:02.079
[Aneet Narendranath]: I needed an Irb because I have multiple course codes going into the documentation. You can only have one course code per irb document. This was the issue, so that those, those were some challenges I had. So the people the the person I spoke with. They were open to the whole idea of pursuing blanket Irbs. It's not common, they said.

529
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.750
[Aneet Narendranath]: just so. We can investigate it.

530
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:08.460
Chang Kyoung Choi: That's good idea thing. Let's let's let's hear what they said.

531
00:48:08.712 --> 00:48:11.987
[Aneet Narendranath]: So I just thought I'd mention that before we go too far ahead.

532
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:18.669
[Aneet Narendranath]: That's 1 of the biggest holdups, you know. It's time it's time. So that's such a big administrative footprint to

533
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:24.313
[Aneet Narendranath]: do the paperwork. Submit it, and it comes back. It said, No, no, doesn't make sense. You need to do something else.

534
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:33.259
[Aneet Narendranath]: clarifying the research questions, articulating? Who are the participants articulating? What kind of data where it will be stored, how it will be stored, what will happen if it gets breached

535
00:48:34.173 --> 00:48:38.870
[Aneet Narendranath]: how long it will be stored. Doctor Chai probably did that for biological samples.

536
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.260
[Aneet Narendranath]: So

537
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.680
[Aneet Narendranath]: so something to consider, okay?

538
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.147
[Aneet Narendranath]: And I think Rajesh has to do that for the Eab.

539
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:48.890
Chang Kyoung Choi: Yeah, he is.

540
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.638
[Aneet Narendranath]: I really need to start like yesterday.

541
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.920
[Aneet Narendranath]: It doesn't stop us from doing what we're doing as long as we don't publish it.

542
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.000
[Aneet Narendranath]: But you know, if you're using human subjects, you really need irp.

543
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.569
Radheshyam Tewari: Yeah, yeah.

544
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.180
[Aneet Narendranath]: Who are using human subjects so.
