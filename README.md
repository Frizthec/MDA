The purpose of the MetaDiscourse Analysis (MDA) library is to develop and provide access to tools for local dictionary Meta Discourse Analysis of text. This library focues on studying Discourse marker usage and distribution. 

## Discourse Markers
Discourse markers are words used to link, describe, and organize ideas in written and verabal discourse. In broad terms, they are organized into ten categories: Code Gloss, Endorphics, Evidentials, Framemarkers, Transition, Attitude markers, Emphatics, Person Markers, Engagement, and Hedges. 

### Code Gloss
These markers are used to adjust the meaning of a phrase or idea. 
Examples include: i.e., (for) instance, defined (as)
### Endorphics
These markers are used to point to additional information or evidence, after it has been stated that evidence exists. 
Examples include: "Chapter", "Figure", "Table"
### Evidentials
These markers relate support for an idea or concept in a general form, as opposed to endorphics.
Examples include: "Cite", "Quote", "According" (to)
