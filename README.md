This library focues on studying Discourse marker usage and distribution in a wide variety of discourse genre, not limited to (1) In-classroom discourse such as lectures, student written reflections, verbal presentations, (2) Entrepreneurial discourse such as pitches, (3) Political discourse such as presidential debates and op-eds.

## Why is this package relevant and unique?

Metadiscourse is embedded in everyday communication actions.  Based on Hyland's taxonomy metadiscourse are those unary or compound words and phrases that allow a person to take an authorial stance.  In other words, metadiscourse is not _what_ one says, but **how** one says it.


## Metadiscourse Markers
Discourse markers are words used to link, describe, and organize ideas in written and verabal discourse. In broad terms, they are organized into ten categories: Code Gloss, Endorphics, Evidentials, Framemarkers, Transition, Attitude markers, Emphatics, Person Markers, Engagement, and Hedges. While there are words that are most commonly used in a specific category, they may be used in multiple categories, or their specific usage may be best determined based on context. 

### Code Gloss
These markers are used to adjust the meaning of a phrase or idea. 
Examples include: i.e., (for) instance, defined (as)
### Endorphics
These markers are used to point to additional information or evidence, after it has been stated that evidence exists. 
Examples include: "Chapter", "Figure", "Table"
### Evidentials
These markers relate support for an idea or concept in a general form, as opposed to endorphics.
Examples include: "Cite", "Quote", "According" (to)
### Framemarkers
These markers indicate that the discourse is moving through stages. There are four types of Frame markers: Sequencing, Announce Goals, Lables, and Shift Topics. 
#### Announce Goals

Examples include: "this", "aim", "focus"
